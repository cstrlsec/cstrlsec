## 🧠 Who Am I?

I'm a 16-year-old self-taught cybersecurity enthusiast, tooling around in Python, breaking down scripts, and learning how stuff works — by poking at it.

I like:
- 🛠️ Building diagnostics / sysinfo tools
- 👣 Messing with GitHub tools, skidding (for now 😉)
- 🧪 Learning Python, basic reverse engineering, and system internals
- 🎯 Cybersecurity — Red Team flavored

---

## 🚧 Currently Learning
- Python scripting
- Network fundamentals
- Linux tooling
- OSINT & basic CTF challenges
- Git + GitHub workflows

---

## 💼 Projects (Coming Soon)
- `syspeek`: PC diagnostics toolkit (WIP)
- `castrolkit`: Collection of tiny CLI scripts for system info / enumeration
- `skidlab`: Sandbox repo for testing random GitHub tools I find interesting

---

## 📫 Contact
- GitHub DMs or open an issue on any of my repos
